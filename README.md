# dndAssist

# Project Details 

DnD Assist is meant to be a simple discord bot that sends requests to DND5e's API and return simple data. 

This bot is meant to be an assistant to the DM. The DM can use a quick command and some key words to query DND5e and the response from the bot will be specific data matching the keyword and extrapolated into a quickly digestable format.

# Technologies

This project is mainly using Discord.JS for interacting with Discord's API.
This bot sends queries from slash commands to DND5e's API requesting official class/monster/etc information.

# Commands

Example Commands:
/dasClass >Class< - returns requested class information
/dasMonster >Monster< returns requested monster information
/dasSpell >Spell< - returns requested spell information


# Issues/Stretch fixes
I would like to add images to the embed on requests but currently not sure if there is a library of monster images available vs looking for alternative solutions.
